1
Get to know your CCO
OHP has local health plans that help you use
your benefits. These plans are called coordinated
care organizations or CCOs. Most OHP members
are enrolled in a CCO.
Your CCO can help you get the care you need. Your CCO works
with providers like doctors, counselors, nurses and dentists near you.
You can find a list of providers on your CCO’s website. You can also
call your CCO and ask for a list.
If you are new to OHP, your CCO will send you a welcome letter and
ID card about two weeks after you get OHP.
• If you need to get care before then, you can contact any
provider that takes OHP.
You may not be in a CCO because you have other insurance or have
a medical reason for not using a CCO. This is called having an open
card or fee-for-service.

Pick your provider
A primary care provider is who you will see for
regular visits, prescriptions and care. You can pick
one, or your CCO can help you pick one. Primary
care providers can be doctors, nurse practitioners
and more. Don’t forget to ask your CCO about a dentist
and a mental health provider.
If you do not pick a provider you want to see, your CCO will
pick one for you. Your CCO will send you a letter with your
provider’s information. Some CCO ID cards also list your provider.
You can look for providers at bit.ly/CCOplans.
Find your CCO in the list and click “Provider Directory.”
Don’t have a CCO? Call 800-562-4620 to get help
finding a provider.

Make an appointment
You can make an appointment with your
provider as soon as you pick one. Tell your
provider about your OHP, CCO and any other health
coverage you have. Have your ID card ready when
you call.
Bring a list of questions to ask your provider. Be ready to talk
about your family’s health history, and any prescriptions, vitamins
or other medicines you take.
Your provider may give you a prescription or instructions to
follow later. If you don’t understand, ask questions. Your provider
is there to help.
Need a ride? Rides are free. If you need a ride to or from
your appointment, call your CCO. If you do not have a
CCO, call the OHP ride service in your area. For a list of
ride services, go to bit.ly/ridesohp.
Need an interpreter? Your OHP provider can help you
get one. Tell your provider’s office or clinic what language
is best for you. Let them know one or two days before
your appointment. Still need help? Call 844-882-7889.
